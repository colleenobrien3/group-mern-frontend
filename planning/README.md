After a long day of work, Sharon boards the metro for her half hour commute home.

Her best friend Karen has sent her a link to Recipe Rolodex, a new app that makes it easy to find quick and tasty recipes for any occassion! Karen has just posted her famous 10 minute taco salad recipe, and Sharon feels relief wash over her. If Karen says it's quick and simple, it will be. She opens the app and sees Karen's recipe displayed on the home page. It couldn't be easier - the ingredients and steps are all right there. Soon to be feasting on a delicious meal, Sharon feels the corners of her mouth curling into a smile. She can't wait to post one of her own go-to recipes to help the next person in need.
